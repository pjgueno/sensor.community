* sensor ID is the ChipID of the ESP8266 (NodeMCU) that you noted down before
* your email address (will not be published)
* your address: Street with house number, postcode and city. Click on "Lookup entered address" to get the location coordinates (will be rounded off). Check the position of the pin, change it if needed
* set a personal sensor name to make it easier to separate them if you have multiple sensors (like garden, sensor for mom,...)
* the surroundings of the station - e.g. height above ground, side of the road, high traffic volume, free field or similar
