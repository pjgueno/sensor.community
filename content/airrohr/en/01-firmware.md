title: Driver & firmware
---

We already prepared the firmware. You only have to install drivers and flash your NodeMCU (ESP8266). 

To communicate with your NodeMCU (ESP8266) you need usb2serial drivers for your operating system. 

The chipset for NocdeMCUs v3 is usually CH341, just check the back of your NodeMCU (ESP8266) to find some technical information. 

Choose the link that corresponds to the operating system of your computer.

Connect NodeMCU to your computer with a short micro-USB cable (choose one shorter than 1 Meter, otherwise the installation may fail). Select `latest_en.bin` (or another language version) and click ‚ÄúUpload‚Äù.
Wait until the process is done. Now we can assemble the sensor.

#### Linux: Set permissions as executable
After the download you may have to set the permission to executable. This can be done with the command: `chmod o+x <download filename>`
